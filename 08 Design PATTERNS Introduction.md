## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Experience reuse** > Code reuse.
- Patterns provide **flexibility**, **maintainability**, and **shared vocabulary**.
- OO principles: **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Polymorphism**, **Inheritance**.
- Design for **change** and **extensibility**.

---

### ✅ Recommended Use
- Use patterns to **recognize places in your designs** where they apply.
- Build **flexible, maintainable systems** that cope with change.
- Speak the **language of patterns** with your team.

# 📘 Intro to Design Patterns

## 1. Welcome to Design Patterns
**Someone has already solved your problems.**  
In this chapter, you’ll learn why (and how) you can exploit the wisdom and lessons learned by other developers who’ve been down the same design problem road and survived the trip.

Before we’re done, we’ll look at:
- The **use and benefits** of design patterns.
- Key **object-oriented (OO) design principles**.
- An example of how one pattern works.

The best way to use patterns is to:
- **Load your brain** with them.
- **Recognize places** in your designs and existing applications where you can **apply them**.

Instead of **code reuse**, with patterns you get **experience reuse**.

---

### 💡 Key Thoughts
> Knowing concepts like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism does not make you a good object-oriented designer.  
> A design guru thinks about how to create **flexible designs** that are **maintainable** and can **cope with change**.
